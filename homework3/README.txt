This is README.txt for HOMEWORK #3. 

Key things to note:
1. When latency is equal to 0, it is conditions to be set as 1. As I am using wxTimer to operate the delay and its parameter would not accept 0 as input. Thus this method was valided by TA / piazza @154.

2. When program is executed for the first time, there seems to be different colors showing on decoded image but i believe this is due to system. After the first operation of the program, it will work as it is expected.
